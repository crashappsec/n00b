 *  Name:           capq.c
 *  Description:    A queue whose primary dequeue operation only
 *                  dequeues if the top value is as expected.
 *
 *                  The naive pop() operation on top of cap() retries
 *                  until it succeeds, making that operation
 *                  lock-free.
 *
 *                  However, the whole purpose of this queue is to
 *                  support a wait-free help system, where threads
 *                  stick jobs into the queue, and then process items
 *                  until their item has been processed.
 *
 *                  The compare-and-pop operation makes sure that
 *                  threads can "help" the top() item, yet, if
 *                  multiple threads try to pop it, only one will
 *                  succeed. Threads in that situation do NOT retry
 *                  the cap, so as long as the enqueue and cap
 *                  operations are wait-free, we're in good shape.
 *
 *                  In this queue, the head acts much like hq, in that
 *                  it FAA's, in a ring buffer, and if it catches up
 *                  with the tail, then it resizes the queue.
 *
 *                  The tail only updates via CAS.  We use the 'epoch'
 *                  as the thing that we compare against, and the tail
 *                  epoch is bumped up by 1<<32 for each migration,
 *                  just to ensure there's never any reuse.
