 *  Name:           q64.h
 *  Description:    A variant of our wait-free queue for x86 systems
 *                  lacking a 128-bit compare and swap.
 *
 *  Author:         John Viega, john@zork.org
 *
 * In the 128-bit version of the algorithm, fields get a full 64 bits
 * for data, and then a state field where most of the state is unused.
 *
 * In this version, we steal the two low bits for the state we
 * need. That means contents must either be pointers, or must fit in
 * 62 bits.
 *
 * In the case of pointers, they will be memory aligned, so stealing
 * the two bits is not going to impact anything. For non-pointer
 * values though, they should be shifted left a minimum of two bits.
