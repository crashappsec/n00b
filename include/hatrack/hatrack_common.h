/* hatrack_mem_hook_t
 *
 * Function pointer to a function of two arguments. This is used for
 * memory management hooks in our higher-level dict and set
 * implementations:
 *
 * 1) A hook that runs to notify when a user-level record has been
 *    ejected from the hash table (either via over-write or
 *    deletion). Here, it's guaranteed that the associated record is
 *    no longer being accessed by other threads.
 *
 *    However, it says nothing about threads using records read from
 *    the hash table. Therefore, if you're using dynamic records, this
 *    hook should probably be used to decrement a reference count.
 *
 * 2) A hook that runs to notify when a user-level record is about to
 *    be returned.  This is primarily intended for clients to
 *    increment a reference count on objects being returned BEFORE the
 *    table would ever run the previous hook.
 *
 * The first argument will be a pointer to the data structure, and the
 * second argument will be a pointer to the item in question. In
 * dictionaries, if both a key and a value are getting returned
 * (through a call to dict_items() for example), then the callback
 * will get used once for the key, and once for the item.
 *
 * This type happens to have the same signature as a different memory
 * management hook that MMM uses, which is indeed used in implementing
 * these higher level hooks.  However, the meaning of the arguments is
 * different, so we've kept them distinct types.

/* hatrack_view_t
 *
 * All our calls to return a view of a hash table (generally for the
 * purposes of some kind of iteration) return the hatrack_view_t.
 *
 * When requested, views can be sorted by insertion time (to the best
 * of the algorithm's ability... some are better than others). The
 * semantics here is identical to Python dictionaries:
 *
 * 1) If { K : V1 } is in the table, and we write { K : V2 } over it,
 *    the new item in the 'replace' operation keeps the logical
 *    insertion order of the original item.
 *
 * 2) If { K : V1 } is removed, then a new item inserted with the same
 *    key (even { K : V1 }), the time of re-insertion is the new
 *    insertion time for the purposes of sort ordering.
 *
 * Our view operations all go through the hash table, pick out live
 * entries, and stick them in an array of hatrack_view_t objects, and
 * then sort that array (either via qsort, or in some cases an
 * insertion sort).
 *
 * While the end user probably doesn't need the sort epoch, we give it
 * to them anyway, instead of coping just the items post-sort.  We
 * even give it to them if we are NOT sorting.
