 *  Name:           witchhat.h
 *  Description:    Waiting I Trully Cannot Handle
 *
 *                  This is a lock-free, and wait freehash table,
 *                  without consistency / full ordering.
 *
 *                  Note that witchhat is based on hihat1, with a
 *                  helping mechanism in place to ensure wait freedom.
 *                  There are only a few places in hihat1 where we
 *                  need such a mechanism, so we will only comment on
 *                  those places.
 *
 *                  Refer to hihat.h and hihat.c for more detail on
 *                  the core algorithm, as here, we only comment on
 *                  the things that are different about witchhat.
