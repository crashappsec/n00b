 *  Name:           hq.h
 *  Description:    A fast, wait-free queue implementation.
 *
 *  Author:         John Viega, john@zork.org
 *
 * I've decided to build a queue that doesn't use segments; instead,
 * it uses a single buffer in a ring, and resizes up if the head
 * pointer catches up to the tail pointer.
 *
 * Once I realized it was possible, it seemed more likely to work well
 * than continually allocing and freeing segments. And that does
 * indeed seem to be the case. The difference is particularly stark
 * when there are few enqueuers, but lots of dequeuers; the "skipping"
 * of the wait mechanism slows down the segment queue, because it will
 * end up doing a lot more mallocing than this one, which only ever
 * doubles the entire queue in size when it needs to grow.
