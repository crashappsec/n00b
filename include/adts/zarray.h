 *  Name:           zeroarray.h
 *  Description:    A fast array that can expand without relocating.
 *
 *                  The idea with zeroarray is to use zero-mapped
 *                  pages to reserve a size far bigger than we ever
 *                  think we might need.
 *
 *                  Modern OSes are happy to give out large
 *                  allocations where each page, by default, maps to
 *                  the zero page, so uses no memory until there's a
 *                  write, at which point copy-on-write semantics kick
 *                  in.
 *
 *                  There generally won't even be entries in the page
 *                  table until the memory is used, so we can safely
 *                  allocate fairly large chunks.
 *
 *                  The primary motivation for this exact data
 *                  structure though is for the n00b's garbage
 *                  collector-- we will keep information about the
 *                  garbage collector's roots in a zero-array. Here,
 *                  multiple threads might need to add roots, and
 *                  contention to write might be possible, but read
 *                  contention should not be an issue.
 *
 *                  Basically, growing the array is done by
 *                  fetch-and-add of an index; we specify the cell
 *                  size up front.
 *
 *                  The total allocation size for a zeroarray is
 *                  fixed; instead of doing a linked list or a
 *                  migration, we just keep it simple. In the case of
 *                  the N00b GC, we can eventually determine how much
 *                  space we need for storing roots statically, but we
 *                  never really will need a whole ton of space, so if
 *                  we alloc a MB we'd never use it all (it'd hold
 *                  info on over 60k roots).
 *
 *                  The interface actually is calloc-like in that you
 *                  provide the maximum number of data objects you
 *                  want to be able to store, and the size for the
 *                  data objects in bytes-- the size must already be
 *                  16-byte aligned.
 *
 *                  Any requested allocation amount will actually be
 *                  rounded up to a multiple of the page size.
 *
 *                  Additionally, we put guard pages around the
 *                  allocation.
 *
 *                  Cell slots are given out atomically via FAA.
 *
 *                  It's assumed the caller deals with synchronization
 *                  on the cell level if needed; n00b's GC doesn't
 *                  really need it; writes only happen once, and write
 *                  in an order where there's never any issue.
