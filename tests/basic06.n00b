"""
Basic test of ranged loops, and the magic loop variables ($i and $last).

Currently, there's a bug here where the block scope of the loop index
should be limited to loop bodies, but is not.

This results in warnings, that we're currently accepting. So in the
long term, this test will change, as it actually should not warn.
