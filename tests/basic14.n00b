"""
Initial tests for native function declaration and calls.

`f()` should be generic, and thus the actuals should be properly boxed
/ unboxed.

The calls to `sum1` should not be boxed, and, because it is a `once`
function, should be properly memoized, meaning it should always return
the same thing.
